        "This code is a simple text-based Hangman game in Python. Let me break it down step by step:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The Hangman Art (HANGMANPICS)\n",
        "HANGMANPICS is a list of strings that represent the stages of the hangman game.\n",
        "There are 7 stages, starting from an empty gallows to a fully completed hangman (showing parts of the figure like the head, body, arms, and legs).\n",
        "The player's incorrect guesses increment the update_display variable, which updates the hangman figure.\n",
        "2. Word Selection (word_list and chosen_word)\n",
        "word_list contains several words like \"aardvark,\" \"baboon,\" etc.\n",
        "The game randomly selects one word from this list using random.choice(word_list), converting it into a list of characters (so it can be compared easily).\n",
        "For example, if the word is \"camel,\" it will become ['c', 'a', 'm', 'e', 'l'].\n",
        "3. Displaying the Word as Blanks (blank and blank_list)\n",
        "The word is initially displayed as a series of underscores (_) representing each letter in the chosen word.\n",
        "If the word is \"camel\", the player will see _ _ _ _ _ at the start.\n",
        "This is stored in blank_list, which will be updated with correct guesses during the game.\n",
        "4. The making_a_guess() Function\n",
        "This function handles the player's guess and checks if it matches any letter in the chosen_word.\n",
        "It compares the guessed letter (guess) with each letter in the chosen_word.\n",
        "If the guess is correct, it replaces the corresponding underscore in blank_list with the guessed letter.\n",
        "If the guess is wrong, it increments update_display, which advances the hangman figure.\n",
        "5. Game Flow\n",
        "The game starts by displaying the initial hangman figure (HANGMANPICS[0]) and prompting the user to make a guess.\n",
        "The player is asked to input a guess. If the guess is correct, the blank spaces (_) are updated to reveal the letter in the correct positions.\n",
        "If the guess is incorrect, the hangman figure progresses by one stage, as update_display increments.\n",
        "6. The while Loop\n",
        "The game continues as long as update_display is less than 6 (i.e., fewer than 6 wrong guesses).\n",
        "After each guess, the program checks whether the player has correctly guessed the word (blank_list == chosen_word). If so, the game prints \"YOU WIN!\" and breaks the loop.\n",
        "If the player makes 6 incorrect guesses, the hangman is fully drawn, and the game ends with \"GAME OVER.\"\n",
        "Summary of the Game's Flow\n",
        "A random word is selected and displayed as underscores (_).\n",
        "The player is prompted to guess letters.\n",
        "For correct guesses, the blanks are filled in with the correct letters.\n",
        "For incorrect guesses, the hangman figure progresses.\n",
        "The game ends when the player either guesses the word (wins) or makes 6 incorrect guesses (loses).\n",
        "This is the basic logic of the Hangman game"
